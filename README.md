There are two different algorithms where we trained tested the raw dataset. for limited amount of hardware resourses transfer based learning used where I downloaded pre-trained network layers tranied the raw datasets according to them and finally found discision layer. My project was to find out which algorithm works better in a real-time situation. 

there are Two algorithm here to run 

**Single Shot Multibox detector** 

run the demo
